In order to play Asteroids_oo.py you will first need to install Pygame.
Pygame can be installed with the included executable shell script 
install_pygame.sh, just in the command line run ./install_pygame.sh  

pygame install may take some time and will be on the solving environment
screen for a while but it should eventually install

Once pygame is installed you can run the Asteroids game by using the command
python Asteroids_oo.py in the command line (If this doesnt work you may have 
					    to open the file and uncomment 
					    Asteroids_Game().run() at the 
					    bottom of the script.)
